brackets-db Manager
====================

A brackets extension to querying a database server, now only support SQL server.

Now it's only offer basic functionality, like browse databases, tables, show table fields, show table data in a paging table, run query (all text in a document or just a selection of it).

It is actually a modified of https://github.com/Azakur4/brackets-database because I need some functionality that's not available on it, then I have some idea to develop it to something more than just a modified version of Azakur4's plugin.

To do
====================
[ ] Show list of view
[ ] Show and edit view
[ ] Show list of function
[ ] Show and edit function
[ ] Show table trigger
[ ] Edit table fields
[ ] Edit table data
[ ] Add mysql support
[ ] Add postgresql support

PLease report/info me about bug, issue and idea, so I can fix and improve this addon, thanks.
